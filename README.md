## Setting up for testing

1. Install mysql on your system. https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/
2. Connect to mysql as the root user you set up: `mysql -u root -p` (or use whatever db tool you prefer)
3. Create the clueless database: `> CREATE DATABASE clueless;`
4. Add the clueless application mysql user: `> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'clueless'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'Password1';`
5. Create all of the tables by running the commands from 'create_tables.sql'
6. Make sure you have python 3 and pip installed. As a bonus, I highly recommend setting up a virtual environment to install things into.
Haven't read this page so I hope it's the right thing, but it seems useful: https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/
7. Install the python requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (from inside the server directory)
8. If that didn't work... it's probably mysql causing the issues. You might need to install some other stuff and unfortunately I don't know what but let me know if I can help.
9. Run the server: `python3 network_service.py`
10. Make sure in the Unity 'NetworkManager' class the host is set to 'localhost:50051'
11. You should be good! Everything is running local
